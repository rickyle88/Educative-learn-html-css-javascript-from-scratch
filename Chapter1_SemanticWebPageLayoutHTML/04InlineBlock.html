        Block-level elements #Block-level HTML elements take up the full width of a web page, essentially creating a “block” around the content you place within that element. Block-level elements, by default, also start on a new line. Most of the elements we have dealt with so far are block-level elements, including:
	* 
        Headings (<h1>-<h6>)
	* 
        Ordered and Unordered Lists (<ol>, <ul>)
	* 
        List Items (<li>)
	* 
        Paragraphs (<p>)

        Inline elements #
                Inline elements, like the name suggests, do not take up the full width of a webpage and are generally in-line with text content. Inline elements also do not start a new line when rendered in the browser. Examples of inline elements include:
	* 
                Anchors (<a>)
	* 
                Images (<img>)
	* 
                Bolding Text (<strong>)
	* 
                Emphasizing Text (<em>)
